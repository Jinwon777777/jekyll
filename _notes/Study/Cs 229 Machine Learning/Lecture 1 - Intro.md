### Machine Learning?
Make machine learn itself.
Better perform when problem's narrow

### Supervised Learning
- problem on mapping input x to output y
- Given both input x, output y
### Unsupervised Learning
- No labels
### Regression VS Classification
- Y value is continuous -> Regression
- Y value is discrete -> Classification
### Reinforced Learning
### Input
- Most often given multidimensional value with multi-type
