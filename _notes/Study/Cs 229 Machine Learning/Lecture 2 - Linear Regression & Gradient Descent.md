### Linear Regression
- One of simplest

Supervised learning
Have data -> feed to algorithm -> output(hypothesis)
hypothesis can be used to predict y with other data

in linear regression, hypothesis looks like y= t0 + x1*t1 ...
can be expressed using sigma

### How to choose parameter?
algorithm's job is to choose fit parameter.
